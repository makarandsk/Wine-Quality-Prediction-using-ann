# Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-ann
Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Deep Learning Algorithms for Classification Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.

# Description

# Context
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

# Content
For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity 

2 - volatile acidity 

3 - citric acid 

4 - residual sugar 

5 - chlorides 

6 - free sulfur dioxide 

7 - total sulfur dioxide 

8 - density 

9 - pH 

10 - sulphates 

11 - alcohol 

Output variable (based on sensory data): 

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10) 

# Steps

1. Import Required Libraries
2. Import Dataset
3. Understand the dataset
4. Perform the EDA
5. Check for outliers
6. Separate the data into input features and target feature
7. Perform feature scaling on input features
8. Check the correlation among the data
9. Handle the imbalanced data
10. Spilt the data into training and testing
11. Create a model
12. Make sure if the data is flattened and encoded properly
13. Build the model
14. Train the model
15. Predict the model
16. Check for accuracy and classification report
17. For satisfied performance of the model repeat steps 13, 14, 15, and 16 by hypertunning the model
